### Defined operators have relevant overhead

> The usage of defined operators, e.g, for abstract calculus, **involves relevant overhead** with respect equivalent **plain intrinsic** operators.

### Confirmed

The tests provided seem to confirm the existence of relevant overhead:

+ to be completed.

### DEFY Tests

DEFY provides the following tests for this myth demystification:

+ [defined operators 1](https://github.com/szaghi/DEFY/tree/master/src/defined_operators_have_overhead/defined_operators_1);
