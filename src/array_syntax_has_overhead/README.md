### Array syntax has relevant overhead

> The usage of array syntax **involves relevant overhead**.

### Not completely demystified

Array syntax allows a very concise and clear array manipulation. In some circumstances, array syntax could introduce relevant
overhead with respect other *lower level optimized* manipulations.

### DEFY Tests

DEFY provides the following tests for this myth demystification:
+ [array resize 1](https://github.com/szaghi/DEFY/tree/master/src/array_syntax_has_overhead/array_resize_1);

See their README.md to see the results obtained.
